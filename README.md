What is Zettelkasten?
Zettelkasten is a note-taking and knowledge management method that was popularized by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. The term "zettelkasten" translates to "slip box" in English. The method involves creating and interlinking small , atomic notes, each representing a single idea or concept. These notes are then organized and connected in a non-hierarchical manner within a physical system.

The key principles of Zettelkasten include:
1. Atomicity: Each note should encapsulate a single, well-defined idea or concept.
2. Interlinking: Notes are connected through links or references, allowing for the exploration of relationships between ideas.
3. Emergent Structure: Instead of imposing a predefined structure, the organization of notes emerges naturally as you create and link them over time.
4. Incremental Growth: The Zettelkasten grows gradually as new ideas and insights are added, fostering an organic and evolving knowledge base.
5. Serendipity: The non-linear structure of Zettelkasten encourages serendipitous discoveries and connections between seemingly unrelated ideas.
